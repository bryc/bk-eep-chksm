### Rare's Checksum Algorithm
This is an implementation of Rare's checksum algorithm in plain C. It's used in a couple of Rare's N64 titles to verify data integrity, mostly in the EEPROM data. The algorithm was reverse-engineered using Nemu64's debugger. This allows checksums to be calculated on any input and can allow modification of save files.

Games that use this checksum:
  1. Banjo Kazooie
  2. Banjo Tooie
  3. Goldeneye 007 (same checksum as Tooie)
