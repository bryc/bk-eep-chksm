### Rare's Checksum Algorithm

This is an implementation of the internal checksum algorithm used for checking save data in some of Rare's games. It should be useful for anyone trying to make a save editor or anything that requires generating valid checksums. Might be useful for anyone attempting to manually edit *.eep files as well.

Games that use this checksum:

1. Banjo Kazooie
2. Banjo Tooie
3. Goldeneye 007 (same checksum as Tooie)
