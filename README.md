### Banjo-Kazooie EEPROM Checksum Algorithm


This is an implementation of the checksum algorithm both Banjo-Kazooie and Tooie use for checking save data in EEPROM. It should be useful for anyone trying to make a save editor or anything that requires generating valid checksums. Might be useful for anyone attempting to manually edit *.eep files as well.
