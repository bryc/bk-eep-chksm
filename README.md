### Banjo-Kazooie EEPROM Checksum Algorithm


This is an implementation of the checksum algorithm both Banjo-Kazooie and Tooie use for checking save data in the EEPROM. It was reversed using the debugger in Nemu64. It is useful for anyone trying to make a save editor, or even wanting to modify save files. The checksum gets in the way of that, and without knowing the algo you can't change anything.
